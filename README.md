# Effect-of-Sensor-Selection-and-Features-on-Inter-Subject-emotion-classification
# Overview
This repository contains code and data for a research project focused on inter-subject emotion classification using electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals. The project investigates the impact of sensor selection and the effectiveness of different EEG feature domains in achieving multilevel emotion classification across subjects. The analysis is conducted on the publicly available DEAP dataset and involves the exploration of sensor groups, time and frequency domain EEG features, and nonlinear EEG features.

# Abstract
Inter-subject emotion classification using EEG signals is a challenging task due to the lack of generalizability in computed features across subjects. In this project, we investigate the impact of sensor selection on inter-subject multilevel emotion classification using the DEAP dataset. We explore four groups of sensors, compute various EEG features (time, frequency domain, and nonlinear), and analyze their relative efficacy in capturing the generalizable components of EEG signals for emotion classification.

# Key Findings
Emotion classification accuracy improves significantly after 20 seconds from the beginning of the stimulus.
Increasing the number of sensors beyond 10 enhances inter-subject emotion classification accuracy.
Time domain features outperform frequency domain and nonlinear features in classifying multilevel emotions in an inter-subject domain.
